## Merry-Go-Round
The simulation creates the experience of riding a merry-go-round. The user can expect to be able to change the theme, light colors, spin on the ride, and clean the ride. The MerryGoRound class creates a merry-go-round object that allows for customizations to spin speed, horse speed, light brightness, is clean, duration, and capacity of the merry-go-round. This is associated with a secondary class named Capacity, allowing users to determine the number of horses on the ride.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
